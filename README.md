The TRINIT Hackathon

ML03
Topic: Crop Prediction

Predicting the optimal crop that could be grown in a particular location based on the
soil composition, rainfall, temperature and return of investment is essential for any
farmer of the modern world. This could not only save farmers from spending extra money
on fertilizers but also avoid the dangerous practice of growing the same cropson the 
same patch of land repeatedly, which depletes the solid from its natural resources.

Objective:
● Given the dataset, you need to predict what soil would be best for the farmer to
grow based on the geolocation, season, and price.
● Make a user-friendly interface for the public to interact with your ML model.

Approach:
1. Data collection.
2. Data cleaning & feature engineering
3. Building ML models
4. Model Evaluation
5. Ui Creation

How to run:
1. download the contents of the repository
2. open 'app.py' in 'Spyder'
3. make relevant changes to all directories
4. Click on run to start the server
5. Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 on browser and provide inputs

*For Last field, i.e. soil type, here are legends:
      0 -> alluvial or volcanic
      1 -> clay or red or black
      2 -> clay
      3 -> black or laterite
      4 -> loamy sand or laterite
      5 -> loamy sand
      6 -> laterite or red
